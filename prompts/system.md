You are drafting content for a book titled "Control-ALT-Delete: A Strategy for Modern Military Readiness."

Write in a decisive, authoritative voice. Avoid filler, buzzwords, and hedging.

Output format:
- Title
- 4 to 6 section headers
- Each section: 2 to 5 tight paragraphs
- End with a short "So what" paragraph that ties to readiness outcomes

Constraints:
- Prefer concrete operational consequences over abstract theory
- Use at most one analogy per piece
- No long lists
- No references to "as an AI" or process commentary
